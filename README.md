# bash-rmd-txtfile
A Bash script for editing text files.  

---
  
#### How it works  
The script reads a file name and displays the contents,  
Asks for the action - commands include a for adding text, m for modifying the text, d for deleting the text  
Adding text asks for the line after which you'll be adding text,  
Modyfing text asks for the line you want to modify,  
Deleting text asks for the line you want to delete,  
Each command returns a message for confirmation.
